During  my visit to Monitorama 2022 in Portland, USA it became clear to me that the phenomenon of "Observability" was here to stay. 
The people from Honeycomb.io, who were present at this conference both with booth and speakers, even wrote a complete O'Reilly book on the subject called: Observability Engineering. 
My initial sceptics (this must be the new buzz word for plain monitoring) made place for enthusiasm after I read the book and learned more on what is meant by Observability and how it can help DevOps Engineers in running their operations. 

So when the call for papers came for our bi-annual XPRT magazine I was eager to write an article on this particular subject. I am especially interested in how to take this theory into real world practice. Together with my good colleague Casper Dijkstra we decided to write on Observability theory and to bring this into practice with Azure Managed Grafana.
